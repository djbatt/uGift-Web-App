# uGift-web-app
==============================================================

uGift is an online service provider for small business owners. It allows small business owners to add online gift cards for dollar amounts and services to their business website.

==============================================================

Business(s) get their own unique URI on our webpage to host their gifting platform

==============================================================

Business owners can have multiple business' stored under one account and manage them all from one dashboard. The application has been built to make sure we are only retrieving the correct data.

The app is based off of Facebook React, with Okta Authentication to handle login/logout. The emails are formatted with MJML and sent through sendgrid

==============================================================

FUTURE ->

Implement Redux (in progress)

Build for proper data requests (in progress)

Rebuild UI (in progress)

After these three have been taken care of and are good enough for me I can continue working on core functionality again. A good foundation is needed so we don't have a shaky prod!
